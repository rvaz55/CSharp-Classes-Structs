# CSharp-Classes-Structs
Practicing using custom 'classes' and 'structs' in C#

####Purpose: ####
Currently, I'm learning C# by reading through 'C# 7.0 in a Nutshell' (Albahari & Albbahari). 
I've created this simple program to solidify the concept of 'classes' and 'structs' and to understand how 
these two objects interact with one another. 

I've left plenty of notes that describe the behavior of the code. These notes helped me 
(and hopefully others) understand how the runs.

####What does this program do? ####
The program creates a custom 'struct' type called 'Books' and a custom 'class' called 'TestStructure'. 
Then the 'TestStructure' class calls the methods of the 'Books' struct to create new 'book' objects and 
display the properties of a particular book.
